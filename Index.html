    I never look into conspiracy theory stuff on my google account, here I am into techy stuff and outdoor things mostly. I just find it really weird how this entire year there hasn't been an even remotely normal news story. Last year I'd hear about advances in technology and science, details about games I play and things I do.  Lately the media has been all about outlandish stories and predictions that everyone forgets about within a week.  What could be the goal here, besides keeping everyone scared?  There hasn't been any source of unbiased news in a long time, but I'm not trying to get political here.  Everyone is just scared, because people and orginizations they dont even trust are telling them to be.  Everyone has opinions, but do the world a favor and have opinions about things that matter. Heres a few to start.
